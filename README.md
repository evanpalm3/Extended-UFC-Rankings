This project uses web scraping to record the outcome of every UFC fight, and uses that data to compile the rankings for each weight class. The motivation for this project is that the UFC only publishes rankings for the top 15 fighters: https://www.ufc.com/rankings

Usage: Run the START.py script, it will then produce the rankings.csv file.
